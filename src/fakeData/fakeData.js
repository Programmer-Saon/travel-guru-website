        "TravelBody":"Cox's Bazar is famous for its long natural sandy sea beach. I have been to Cox's Bazar in all seasons and many times over the last 20 years or so. And I would love to share my practical experience with you! Even 20 years ago Cox's Bazar was relatively a small town. There were lots of hotels, motels and guest houses for tourists' accommodations and restaurants for having a variety of great food still there at around that time. But, over the years Cox's Bazar has been transformed into a busy tourist city. It has more international visitors now than ever. The availability of more recreational facilities is attracting more tourists every year.",
